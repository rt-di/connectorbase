There are multiple implementations how to connect to the backend pipeline server, e.g. Kafka directly via TCP or via a http proxy. 
During the web application start the Java code 

    ServiceLoader.load(IPipelineAPI.class) 

tries to locate one and in this case it did not find any. This is odd as the connectors all have the pipelinehttp-*.jar embedded, 
see the WebApp's /WEB-INF/lib directory.
